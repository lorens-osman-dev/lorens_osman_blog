# Education and Upbringing: A European Rule Forged by Social Necessities

When we look at the notion that the basic education stage which usually spans nine years is a period of "Education and Upbringing" (*Al-Tarbiya wal-Ta'lim*), we find that it did not emerge from a vacuum. Rather, it is the fruit of a long trajectory of historical, social, and intellectual transformations in Europe. Great ideas that turn into laws, rules, and practical applications are often a direct reflection of a society's needs and challenges. Thus, the principle of "Education and Upbringing," which has become a cornerstone of global educational systems today, was formed within the womb of modern European reality, specifically driven by two major impacts: the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution.

### First: The Impact of the French Revolution and the Enlightenment

One of the most prominent results of the French Revolution (1789) was the emergence of a strong wave of hostility toward religion and ecclesiastical institutions, which at the time represented the moral and political reference for society. Revolutionaries raised their famous slogan, "Hang the last king with the guts of the last priest," reflecting their total rejection of the old religious and political authority. As Europe entered the Age of Enlightenment, reason became the new reference instead of religious texts. However, this shift faced a deep dilemma: if religion was sidelined, from where would the moral reference necessary for building and organizing society be derived?

Enlightenment thinkers realized that man-made laws, no matter how powerful, could not alone regulate human behavior or build an internally balanced individual. Laws regulate outward actions, but they do not plant values or build a conscience. From here, the idea of "Upbringing" (*Tarbiya*) was born as an essential component of education to compensate for the absence of religious text. Educational and ethical subjects were included in curricula to raise a new generation carrying human and social values that make society more cohesive without needing the authority of the Church. Thus, Upbringing became a social and intellectual necessity in modern Europe.

### Second: The Impact of the Industrial Revolution

On the other hand, the Industrial Revolution (18th and 19th centuries) brought about massive shifts in the economic and social structure. Europe moved from an agrarian society relying on simple skills to an industrial society requiring qualified workers with a degree of scientific and technical knowledge. Illiteracy or superficial knowledge was no longer sufficient to operate machines, understand mechanics, or handle calculations related to manufacturing.

This reality forced the state and society to establish a basic educational system that provides every citizen with the minimum necessary science and knowledge to be capable of performing their role in the industrial production wheel. From here came the concept of compulsory basic education, making the European citizen an effective "cog" in the massive industrial machine, capable of discipline and adapting to the requirements of modern life.

### The Result: The Birth of the "Education and Upbringing" Rule

Thus, it can be said that the rule of "Education and Upbringing" in basic education arose from the meeting of two fundamental needs:

* **The Ethical and Intellectual Need:** Following the French Revolution, to compensate for the absence of religion as a reference.
* **The Economic and Social Need:** Following the Industrial Revolution, to prepare individuals capable of serving industrial requirements.

Consequently, a rule was formed that soon turned into something resembling an educational law: basic education is not merely a transfer of knowledge, but a dual project combining "Upbringing" to build a human being with internal values and restraints, and "Education" to provide them with the sciences and knowledge necessary for practical life.

The principle of Education and Upbringing, which has become a slogan for basic education stages today, was not an idealistic or abstract theory; it was the fruit of realistic necessities experienced by European society. Over time, this rule spread to the rest of the world as the cornerstone of any modern educational system.

## As a Muslim in the 21st Century, How Does This Concern You?

If we move from the European experience to our reality as Muslims in the twenty-first century, we find ourselves facing a fundamental question: What is our need for this educational rule that arose in European circumstances?

* **The Industrial Need:** European societies were forced to build basic education that serves the Industrial Revolution and prepares individuals to be cogs in the new economic machine. As for us in the Islamic world, most of our countries are still far from being classified as advanced industrial nations; rather, most belong to the category of developing countries. Therefore, the absence of that industrial necessity makes it essential to reconsider our educational curricula and their philosophy. It is not right to import an educational model born in the womb of an experience that is not ours and does not express our reality. We need an educational process that springs from our civilizational depth and actually responds to our contemporary needs, rather than being a mere carbon copy of systems born to serve a different reality.
    
* **The Ethical Need:** Regarding the ethical aspect, the situation is completely different. While Europeans sought to find a substitute for religious morality, we Muslims have been honored by God with a timeless and integrated moral reference: the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH). The Prophet (PBUH) said: _"I was sent only to perfect noble character,"_ and God Almighty described him by saying: _"And indeed, you are of a great moral character"_ (Al-Qalam: 4). When Lady Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked about the character of the Prophet (PBUH), she said: _"His character was the Qur'an."_ After this divine honoring and Lordly reference, do we need to import man-made and deficient ethical systems?

### Conclusion 

From this, it becomes clear that the idea of "Education and Upbringing" as it originated in Europe is not necessarily suitable for our Islamic reality. We need to build an educational philosophy based on our actual needs, inspired by our rich civilization and our divine moral reference, rather than forcing imported educational models onto our reality that were made neither for us nor for our circumstances.
