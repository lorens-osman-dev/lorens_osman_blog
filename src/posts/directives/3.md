# The Third Directive: Trump's Goats and the Illusion of Law

## First: The Story of "Trump's Goats"

Donald Trump’s situation in New Jersey serves as a blatant example of exploiting the "letter of the law" to strike at the "spirit of the law." At one of the luxury golf courses he owns, Trump decided to introduce a number of goats and place a few hay bales—not out of a love for farming, but out of a desire for tax exemptions.

- **The Loophole:** The "Farmland Assessment Act" (1964) aims to protect small farmers by granting them tax exemptions if they dedicate land to agriculture and generate a modest income ($1,000 annually).
    
- **The Exploitation:** Trump "on paper" converted part of his land into a farm using these goats.
    
- **The Astonishing Result:** Instead of paying heavy taxes as commercial or recreational land, Trump paid only about **$700** annually for 119 acres, while saving an estimated **$1.2 million** since 2021 thanks to this circumventive agricultural classification.



## Second: Why Do the Rich Always Win at the "Text Game"?

The secret lies in the fact that the modern legal system has turned into a "maze" that can only be decoded by those who can afford the "map."

### 1. Armies of Consultants and Lawyers
The wealthy do not treat the law as a set of obligations, but as "raw material" to be shaped. They employ the best minds to discover loopholes and structure their wealth in ways that legally minimize taxes and maximize profits.

### 2. System Complexity Serves the Powerful
The more complex the law becomes, the more the average person is unable to understand it. The poor adhere to the law literally out of fear of punishment because they lack the resources to maneuver or negotiate, while the rich see complexity as an opportunity to hide. Thus, a law designed to help small farmers keep their land found its way into the pockets of the wealthy in entirely legal ways.

## Third: A Global Phenomenon.. Beyond "Trump's Goats"

These practices are not isolated incidents but a global approach that entrenches inequality. The rich exploit laws to increase their wealth, making them more powerful, while the poor continue to face financial and legal hardships, increasing their suffering. This system ensures the rich get richer while the poor stay in place or get poorer, undermining the principle of social justice.

- **Offshore Contracts:** The Panama and Pandora Papers revealed how titans spirit away their wealth to remote islands in ways that are ostensibly "legal" but ethically drain their countries' treasuries of tax revenue.
    
- **Tech Giants:** Companies like Amazon and Apple move their profits through accounting to tax havens, resulting in them paying (proportionally) less tax than a small shop owner in a working-class neighborhood.



## Fourth: What Can We Conclude From This Case?
    
In reality, this is not just a story about a goat decorating a field, but about a fundamental flaw in the organization of human collectives: the existence of laws alone is not enough. Donald Trump's experience reveals two fundamental problems in the concept of law and constitution that go beyond this incident to the heart of the relationship between legal texts and human nature.

### Problem One: Laws and Constitutions Regulate Outward Behavior Only
Law, by its nature, does not deal with intentions, but with external actions. Trump did not violate the text of the law, but he twisted its spirit. Bringing the goats was not aimed at agricultural production or land protection, but at obtaining tax exemptions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. This incident confirms that texts alone are incapable of regulating deep human behavior; they see only what is presented to them, while true intentions may move in a completely different direction.

### Problem Two: Legal Complexity Serves the Strong and the Wealthy
With the development of modern societies, the legal system has become immensely complex. This complexity, which is supposed to reflect institutional maturity, has practically transformed into a tool for those with money and legal capacity. The rich can hire lawyers and consultants to discover and cleverly exploit loopholes. Conversely, the poor remain unable to play the game of "legal interpretation" because it requires massive resources they do not possess. The result: the very law designed to protect justice and equality turns into a means of perpetuating class disparities.

Realizing these two dilemmas forces us to rethink the role of laws: they are necessary, but insufficient. What is required is a balance between legal texts and ethical values that prevent the law from turning from a means of justice into a tool of influence.

## Fifth: Law Alone is Not Enough: Between Human Realism and the Necessity of Ethics in State Management

The modern state is often viewed as a neutral entity, governed by a constitution and laws, where direct religious or ideological interference is prevented to ensure justice and equality. While this principle is theoretically sound, complex human reality shows that total reliance on laws—without considering ethics, intention, and human nature—can lead to counterproductive results that threaten the integrity of the state itself.

Logically, no set of laws, no matter how well-crafted, can cover every detail of human life. Laws are formulated to regulate outward behavior—what can be observed and proven—but they are incapable of regulating intentions, measuring values, or monitoring the conscience. Here lies the paradox: a person can master the circumvention of legal texts, using constitutional loopholes or bureaucratic procedures to achieve massive personal gains without being legally condemned, while possessing an internal intent of exploitation, malice, or greed that the law cannot punish.

Imagine a government official who adheres to legal forms in all his decisions but simultaneously uses his position to empower his allies or direct contracts to companies that bring him indirect benefits. Legally, no charge may be proven against him because he did not violate an explicit text. But ethically, he has betrayed his trust and exploited public confidence for private interests. This type of behavior cannot be eradicated by laws alone; it requires moral awareness, a living conscience, and an internal value system that elevates the collective interest over the individual interest.

Human nature, as proven by philosophy and history, is not always rational or honest. Man is a complex being influenced by greed, fear, desire for power, envy, and tribalism. Laws, no matter how strict, cannot change these natures; they only attempt to direct or curb them. Therefore, building a just state does not begin only with writing a constitution or enacting laws, but with raising the human being on values: honesty, integrity, transparency, and a sense of responsibility toward society.

In conclusion, no state can be just or stable solely thanks to a constitution and laws. Societies are built by laws, but they are managed by conscience. The true state is not the one that prevents religion from having an influence, but the one that benefits from supreme human values to build an administrative apparatus that is honest, responsible, and accountable. Law is necessary, but it is not sufficient. Ethics are not an intellectual luxury; they are the cornerstone of building a state managed not just by texts, but by conscience.
