# The Inevitability of Conflict in Life: A Reading of Human Nature and Existence

Humanity has long sought idealism, raising slogans of peace, cooperation, and noble goals. We have long dreamed of a world where harmony prevails, where differences vanish, and hearts unite upon a common word. But is this dream realistic? Can we truly transcend the inevitability of conflict in life, **or is it an integral part of the fabric of our existence**?

A close look at human history and even our daily lives reveals that **conflict is the rule and peace is the exception**. From the dawn of civilizations to our modern era, chapters of conflict over power, resources, ideologies, and even the simplest differences in viewpoints continue to unfold. Despite all claims of nobility and the desire for the public good, the motives for conflict remain persistent and emerge at every turn.

## Why is Conflict Inevitable?

The roots of this inevitability lie in several aspects inherent to human nature and existence itself:

* **Limited Resources:** The planet we live on has finite resources. Whether it is water, fertile land, oil, or even economic opportunities, scarcity creates competition. While this competition may appear on the surface as a pursuit of growth and prosperity, it often turns into a struggle for the largest share.

* **Conflict of Interests:** Every individual and group has its own interests. What may be beneficial for one party may be harmful or useless to another. Even when interests overlap at certain points, the points of divergence are often enough to ignite the spark of dispute. The pursuit of self-actualization and individual or collective superiority is a powerful motive driving toward collision.

* **Intellectual and Ideological Differences:** Humans are complex beings, differing in their way of thinking, beliefs, values, and worldviews. While these differences are a source of diversity and creativity, they are also fertile ground for conflict. Each party sees the correctness of its own viewpoint and may seek to impose or defend it with full force, leading to confrontation.

* **Innate Tendency for Competition and Dominance:** Conflict is an innate trait in humans, stemming from the survival instinct and the competition for dominance. This tendency may be latent, but it appears clearly in moments of hardship or when there is an opportunity to achieve personal or collective gains, even if it requires bypassing others.

## The Mask of Nobility and Declared Goals

What is interesting is how "noble" goals can serve as a mask for conflict. How many wars have been waged in the name of "spreading justice," how many regimes have practiced tyranny in the name of "achieving security," and how many projects have destroyed the environment in the name of "development and progress." The human capacity to justify conflict through higher goals reveals the complexity of human nature, where internal motives intertwine with the outward desire for transcendence.

This does not mean that humans do not seek good or that they cannot cooperate. On the contrary, cooperation is essential for the survival of the human race. However, even at the height of cooperation, there remains a latent struggle—a struggle over leadership, the best methodology, or the distribution of roles—all of which can turn into deep-seated disagreements.

# Shall We Yield to Inevitability?
Recognizing the inevitability of conflict in life is not a call to surrender to chaos or despair. Rather, it is a call for a deeper understanding of our nature and the nature of the world. This understanding can help us manage conflict.

**Conflict Management**

* **Step One: Acceptance instead of Denial:** Instead of denying conflict or trying to eliminate it completely (which is impossible), we can develop better mechanisms to manage our side of the struggle. *"Urge the believers to fight."*
* **Step Two: Understanding vs. Infatuation:** By understanding the true motives of the parties in a conflict, this perspective enables us to see beyond shiny slogans and declared goals to understand the real drivers moving individuals, groups, and states.
* **Step Three: Taking a Position (Entrenchment):** The inevitability of conflict requires a rational person to choose their side consciously, rather than being a puppet moved by others.
* **Negotiation and Seeking Compromise:** Knowing that conflict exists drives us to seek negotiated solutions that satisfy all parties as much as possible, rather than seeking absolute victory.

In the end, conflict may be the spark that drives the wheel of evolution. Great innovations have been born from the womb of struggle, more just systems of governance have emerged, and societies have changed for the better. However, this does not change the fact that conflict itself is an inescapable reality. It is a continuous cycle where the desire for nobility intertwines with the inevitability of clash to form the fabric of life as we know it.
